- [pr #4](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/pull/4): Redesign readme (thanks @weeco!)

Of note, this fixes three races, fixes fetch session bugs and has small
breaking protocol changes in kmsg.

For the three races, two of them are obvious in hindsight, but one makes no
sense and may not belong in franz-go itself. The fix for the third is to remove
a line that we do not need to do anyway.

For fetch sessions, sessions were not reset properly in the face of context
cancelations or across consumer topic reassignments. It was possible for fetch
sessions to get out of sync and never recover. This is fixed by resetting fetch
sessions in all appropriate places.

For kmsg protocol changes, DeleteTopics changed Topics from a list of strings
(topics to delete) to a list of structs where you could delete by topic or by
topic uuid. The Java code coincidentally historically used TopicNames, so it
did not need to break the protocol to add this new struct under the Topics
name. For lack of confusion, we change Topics to TopicNames and introduce the
struct under Topics.

v0.6.3
===

- [`db09137`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/db09137): Add support for new DescribeCluster API (KIP-700); followup commit (`ab5bdd3`) deprecates `Include<*>AuthorizedOperations` in the metadata request.
- [`3866e0c`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/3866e0c): Set Record.Attrs properly before calling Produce callback hook.
- [`05346db`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/05346db) and [`3d3787e`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/3d3787e): kgo: breaking change for kversions breaking change two commits ago (see two lines below)
- [`b921c14`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/b921c14): doc fix: v0.10.0 changed produce from MessageSet v0 to MessageSet v1
- [`33a8b26`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/33a8b26): Breaking pointerification change to kversions.Versions; introduce VersionGuess

Two small breaking changes related to kversions.Versions in this; switching to
pointers now makes the struct future compatible; if it grows, we avoid the
concern of passing around a large struct on the stack.

Contains one small fix related to KIP-360 w.r.t. the idempotent producer: when
we encounter OutOfOrderSequenceNumber, we need to reset _all_ partition's
sequence numbers, not just the failing one. This is now done by resetting
everything the next time the producer ID is loaded. The related Kafka ticket is
KAFKA-12152.

The primary commit of this release is `539b06c`, which completely rewrites the
consumer.go and source.go files to be more easily understandable. This commit
also fixes a bug related to the `sink` and `source` broker pointers; if the
broker changed but kept the same node ID, the `sink` and `source` would not
have their old pointers (to the old broker) updated.

There were some small breaking API changes in the `kmsg` package, most notably,
the metadata request changed one field from a `string` to a `*string` due to
Kafka switching the field from non-nullable to nullable. As specified in the
`kmsg` docs, API compatibility is not guaranteed due to Kafka being able to
switch things like this (and I favor small breakages like this rather than
wrapping every type into a struct with a `null` field).

The `kversion` package has had its `Versions` type completely changed. The new
format should be future compatible for new changes. The current change was
required due to Kafka's `ApiVersions` having a gap in keys that it responds
with in 2.7.0.

Config validation has been strengthened quite a bit.

Includes a few other minor, not too noteworthy changes.

v0.6.1
===

- [`0ddc468b2`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/0ddc468b2ceca4fc0e42206c397f6d7ccd74bc4b): Workaround for two minor EventHubs issues.

This is a small release to patch around two minor EventHubs protocol serializing issues.

v0.6.0
===

- [`0024a93a4`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/0024a93a4d386318869fe029260f3e23a602c03e): Fix bug introduced in pkg/kgo/source.go

This release also changes the name to franz-go. After sitting on frang for a
week, ultimately I was missing the fact that the name related to Kafka. `franz`
is an easy enough mental map, and then this brings back the `-go` suffix.

Multiple generator changes were made to better handle tags, add support for
enums, and parse many files in a `definitions` directory. Minor changes were
made in kgo to use the new `RequestWith` function. More debug & warn log lines
were added around opening a connection and initializing sasl.

This release also changed the name of the repo from "kafka-go" to "frang" to
avoid potential trademark issues down the road.
