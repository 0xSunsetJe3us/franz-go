// DescribeACLsRequest describes ACLs. Describing ACLs works on a filter basis:
// anything that matches the filter is described. Note that there are two
// "types" of filters in this request: the resource filter and the entry
// filter, with entries corresponding to users. The first three fields form the
// resource filter, the last four the entry filter.

  // ResourceType is the type of resource to describe.
  //
  // UNKNOWN, 0, is unknown; you do not describe unknown types. Kafka replies
  // with unknown if it does not understand your type. ANY, 1 will match any
  // other type.
  //
  // Past these two, the following types filter for an individual type:
  // TOPIC is 2, GROUP is 3, CLUSTER is 4, TRANSACTIONAL_ID is 5, and
  // DELEGATION_TOKEN is 6.

  // ResourcePatternType is how ResourceName is understood. UNKNOWN is 0 and is
  // meaningless in the request.
  //
  // MATCH is 1, which will match anything.
  //
  // LITERAL is 2, meaning the name must be an exact match.
  //
  // PREFIXED is 3, meaning a resource name must have our requested resource
  // name as a prefix. That is, topic "foobar" will match "foo".
  //
